## Introduction

Minishell is a simple shell implementation project for 42 School. The goal of this project is to create a small, yet functional shell that can execute commands, manage processes, and handle basic shell functionalities.

* **Command parsing and execution**
* **Built-in commands** (e.g., cd, echo, exit, env, export, unset, pwd)
* **subshell** (e.g., (command1 | (command2)))
* **AND / OR** (e.g., command1 || command2, command1 && command2)
* **Process management** (fork, exec, wait)
* **Input/output redirection** (>, <, >>)
* **woldcacrd** (command *)
* **Pipes** (command1 | command2)
* **Signal handling** (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+\)
* **here doc** (<< lim)
* **Error handling** (syntax error, ambiguous error)
